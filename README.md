# Day-Scheduler
 
This application is meant to allow employees to manage their time effectively.

When the planner is opneed there is a current day displayed at the top of the calendar and when the individual scrolls down
there are time blocks for the current day. Each block is color coded to show whether it is in the future, present or in the past.
Individuals may enter an event and when the page is refreshed after hitting the save icon to the right of the text box then the 
data will persist on the page.

I used jQuery and bootstrap to accomplish this task.
